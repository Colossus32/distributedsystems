### Project Name: 
Distributed Systems Learning Project

### Project Description:
This project is a hands-on exploration of distributed systems, aimed at enhancing my skills and incorporating new technologies into my repertoire. 
The primary goal is to build a modern and scalable system leveraging various technologies.

### Key Features:
Utilizes microservices architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Cloud and Spring Data for efficient and modular development.
Implements messaging queue functionality using Spring RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.
Integrates service registration and discovery with Netflix Eureka for improved scalability.
Monitors and traces the system using Micrometer and Zipkin for performance insights.
Incorporates OpenFeign for declarative REST client communication.
Includes a load balancer for efficient resource distribution.
Uses Docker for containerization, allowing easy packaging and deployment.

### Technologies Used:
Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Data, Spring Cloud
Spring RabbitMQ
Netflix Eureka
Micrometer + Zipkin
OpenFeign
Docker

### Project Goals:
The project aims to create a modern, scalable, and easily deployable system that incorporates essential components of distributed systems, such as messaging queues, service discovery, and load balancing. 
It serves as a practical learning ground for mastering technologies like Spring Boot, RabbitMQ, Eureka, and Docker, contributing to the continuous improvement of my skills.
